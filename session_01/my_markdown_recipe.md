Ingredients:

1 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
1 large egg
2 tablespoons melted butter (plus more for greasing the pan)
Optional: Additional ingredients such as chocolate chips, blueberries, or sliced bananas
Instructions:

In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt until well combined.

In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, and melted butter.

Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and gently stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; a few lumps in the batter are okay. If you're adding any optional ingredients, such as chocolate chips or blueberries, fold them into the batter at this point.

Heat a non-stick frying pan or griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease the surface with butter.

Once the pan is hot, pour about 1/4 cup of the pancake batter onto the pan for each pancake. Use the back of a spoon or a ladle to spread the batter into a circular shape.

Cook the pancakes for about 2-3 minutes, or until small bubbles start to form on the surface.

Carefully flip the pancakes with a spatula and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until the pancakes are golden brown and cooked through.

Remove the pancakes from the pan and keep them warm. You can place them on a plate in a slightly warmed oven (set to low heat) while you cook the remaining batter.

Repeat steps 5-8 with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the pan as needed.

Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings, such as maple syrup, fresh fruits, or whipped cream.
