# About the game
Py-Fighter is a zero-sum game similar to Rock, Paper, Scissors.

You must outwit (or out-luck) the CPU opponent by selecting the move that trumps theirs.

There is a special move called "Power," which can be used when your power gauge is full. Only a fool would attempt to use Power before then.

You and the CPU start with 10 HP each.

The objective is to pummel your opponent to 0 HP before they pummel you!

## Slug
Slug was born in a small, unassuming slug farm. He was a kind and gentle slug, but he was also very weak. The other slugs would often pick on him and make fun of him. One day, Slug decided that he had had enough. He ran away from the farm and vowed to become stronger.

Slug traveled the world, seeking out the harshest training he could find. He trained with the best warriors in the land, and he learned to fight with a variety of weapons. But even with all his training, Slug was still not strong enough.

One day, Slug came across a mysterious old man. The old man told Slug that he could help him become stronger, but there was a price. The old man said that Slug would have to give up his kindness and compassion. Slug was hesitant at first, but he eventually agreed.

The old man gave Slug a potion to drink. The potion made Slug stronger, but it also made him corrupt. Slug became obsessed with power, and he would stop at nothing to achieve his goals. He became a ruthless fighter, and he took pleasure in the pain of others.

Slug is now a powerful fighter, but he is also a dangerous one. He is a threat to everyone he meets, and he will stop at nothing to get what he wants.
