# 2. Print the numbers 1 to 100 (including the number 100).
for range1 in range(1, 101):
  print(range1)

# 3. Print all odd numbers from 1 to 100.
for range2 in range(1, 101, 2):
  print(range2)

# 4. The modern olympics started in 1896, print the years they have been held (bonus points to skip the years it has not been held 1916, 1940, 1944, 2020).
notheld = [1916, 1940, 1944, 2020]
for olyyears in range(1896, 2020, 4):
  if olyyears not in notheld:
    print(olyyears)

# 5. Create a list of ten random numbers. Loop through your list and count the number of even numbers and the number of odd numbers.
randnum = [2, 3, 5, 75, 12, 623, 63, 12, 54, 99]
for range4 in randnum:
  if range4 % 2 == 0:
    print(range4)

# 6. Create a list of five names. Write a loop that will print "Hello" plus each name in the list.
namelist = ["Bob", "Marc", "Alex", "Jim", "John"]
